== Introduction

[.lead]
This document describes the tools that help provision and maintain 
 infrastructure on a Red Hat Openstack Platform.

The tools implemented are the following:

* Provision VMs on RHOSP
* Provision OCP cluster on RHOSP

[glossary]
== Terminology

Glossary of terms used.

[glossary]
FS:: Filesystem
Host:: Target OpenStack instance or VM
OCP:: OpenShift Container Platform
RHOSP:: Red Hat OpenStack Platform

== Requirements

The following requirements must be met to fully use this project.

=== Passwordstore

Passwordstore is used during the execution of the ansible playbooks when RHOSP 
 instances or OCP clusters are created/removed. In one hand it 
 provides information for the deployment process, such as RHOSP authentication, 
 and also to store the results of the process and be used as Ansible 
 inventory.

[NOTE]
====
All RHOSP information will be stored under the `/openstack` passwordstore folder.
====

[#rhosp-authentication]
== RHOSP authentication

As this project connects to a RHOSP infrastructure, authenticating 
 against that platform is needed. Before using this project collect the 
 authentication information that fits your needs.

The default authentication plugin for this project is `v3password`. In order 
 to use this plugin the following information is required.

.RHOSP authentication information
[%header,cols="20%m,80%"]
|===
| Variable | Meaning

| auth_type

a| Authentication plugin that will be used to handle the authentication process. In this scenario the value will be `v3password`.

[TIP]
====
Other values can be selected such as `v3token`.

Check the `openstack` CLI man page or the 
 link:https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/man/openstack.html[OpenStack CLI web man] for a list of possible plugins.
====

| auth_url

a| Authentication URL

| password

a| Authentication password

| project_domain_name

a| Domain name or ID containing project

| project_name

a| Project-level authentication scope (name or ID)

| username

a| Authentication username

| user_domain_name

a| Domain name or ID containing user

|===

[TIP]
====
For more detailed information on RHSOP authentication check the 
 link:https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/authentication.html[OpenStack CLI Authentication] 
 document.
====

=== Ansible playbooks

2 Ansible playbooks are already available to collect the required 
 authentication information from passwordstore.

* *link:../ansible/playbook/openstack/openstack_auth_passstore_v3password.yml[openstack_auth_passstore_v3password.yml] <= Default*
* link:../ansible/playbook/openstack/openstack_auth_passstore_v3applicationcredential.yml[openstack_auth_passstore_v3applicationcredential.yml]

These playbooks collect the required information from the 
 `passwordstore` and fill the `rhos_auth` map and `rhos_auth_type` Ansible host variables that are later used on Playbooks and Roles.

==== openstack_auth_passstore_v3password

The default authentication playbook is `openstack_auth_passstore_v3password.yml` 
 and uses the *v3password* authentication plugin. It collects the 
 required information from the passwordstore.

== Ansible Inventory

The inventory of all RHOSP hosts is managed by Ansible.

[NOTE]
====
Please refer to our link:../ansible/README.adoc[Ansible Document] for more information on the project Ansible Inventory.
====

The host information will be stored under the `openstack` folder where a 
 sub-folder exists for each host. It also stores the SSH public and secret 
 keys locally on the user's `~/.ssh` folder. 

== VM Provisioning

The main goal of the RHOSP tools is to provision hosts and 
 store their information on the team passwordstore inventory for 
 later use by the team members.

Prior to deploying a host aspects such as the OS image and 
 the sizing of the host must be addressed.

=== Preparing the Provisioning

[WARNING]
====
The examples provided here are photos of a specific time frame and 
 RHOSP implementation. To get and updated lists of your available images 
 and flavors check your RHOSP cluster using either 
 the RHOSP console or the link:openstack-cli.adoc[RHOSP CLI].
====

==== OS Image

[quote,RedHat RHOSP Documentation,The Image service (glance)]
A virtual machine image is a file that contains a virtual disk with a bootable operating system installed.

To identify available images and choose which one to use check our docs on the link:openstack-cli.adoc[RHOSP CLI tool] which describe some of the most used commands.

==== Flavors

[quote,RedHat RHOSP Documentation,Flavors]
In OpenStack, flavors define the compute, memory, and storage capacity of nova computing instances. To put it simply, a flavor is an available hardware configuration for a server. It defines the size of a virtual server that can be launched.

Reduced list of flavors obtained from our RHOSP cluster.

A network is an isolated Layer 2 networking segment.

`provider_net_shared` is the default network to be used.

 and in the link:https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/network.html[OpenStack CLI official documentation].

=== Provision the VM

[.lead]
Once the system configuration is identified it's time to create a VM.

Creating the VM is done using pre-prepared Ansible Playbooks. 

[WARNING]
====
Detailed documentation on the playbooks and execution instructions to 
 perform the VM provision operations can be found at our 
 link:../ansible/playbook/openstack/README.adoc[OpenStack Ansible Playbooks] document.
====

To quick create a Host you can use the following command, taking care to 
 check the `network`, `image`, `flavor` and `vm_name` variables 
 that  should be filled according to your implementation.

.Create OpenStack Host command
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook playbook/openstack/openstack_vm_create_passwordstore.yml -e '{"openstack": {"vm": {"network": "provider_net_shared","image": "Fedora-Cloud-Base-37", "flavor": "m1.medium"}}}' -e vm_name=snowdrop_sample_vm_name
----

== Connect to a RHOSP instance

To improve usability the link:../../../tools/passstore-vm-ssh.sh[`tools/passstore-vm-ssh.sh`] 
 bash script has been created. It makes it easier to connect to any 
 host under the project's Ansible Inventory. 
 
More documentation on the bash script can be found link:../tools/README.md[here].

To SSH connect to a VM use the  bash script.

.Sample execution
[source,bash]
----
./tools/passstore-vm-ssh.sh openstack vm20210221-t01
----

This should connect ot the newly created VM.

== Deploy OCP on RHOSP

[.lead]
Set of Ansible Playbooks and Roles that deploy an OCP cluster on RHOSP.

This set of Ansible playbooks will provision an OCP cluster, tailored 
 to the selected size. It will also provision a jump server that will 
 allow ssh connections to the cluster nodes.

To perform this installation check the link:../ansible/playbook/ocp/README.adoc[OCP on RHOSP Ansible Playbooks] document.

== OpenStack CLI

The OpenStack CLI tool comes very handy to perform several checks and 
 information collection. We've created the link:openstack-cli.adoc[RHOSP CLI] 
 document to describe some of the most used commands.
