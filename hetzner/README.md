### Copy your ssh public key to the machine

You need to perform a `ssh-copy-id root@ipaddress` in order to later perform password-less login
The root password is supplied via email when the Hetzner machine is initially created
Save it under the file `pwd.txt`

From a terminal, you can then execute the following command to add your public key within the list of the authorized keys of the cloud vm

E.g

```bash
sshpass -f pwd.txt ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@ipaddress
```
