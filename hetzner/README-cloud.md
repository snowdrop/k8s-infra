# Introduction

This document describes the requirements and the process to execute the provisioning of a Cloud VM on hetzner.

## Scope

Describe the steps to install the hetzner client and provision hetzner cloud VMs.

# Requirements

First of all follow the instructions in the [Ansible Installation Guide section](../ansible/playbook/README.md#installation-guide).

Next, Install the `hcloud CLI` as covered hereafter.

## Install hcloud CLI

For more information on installing Hetzner CLI, check the [Installation section](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli#installation).
 
In MacOS you can install using the following brew command `brew install hcloud`.

For Linux installation, binaries are available at [releases](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli/releases). Download `hcloud-linux-amd64.tar.gz` and extract the `hcloud` 
file into the `~/bin` directory. 

That's it, the CLI is installed and ready to use.

# Hetzner Cloud

The following guide details how to provision a Hetzner VM using the [Hetzner Cloud APi](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#overview) or the  [Hetzner Cloud client](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli).

All Ansible playbooks must be launched from the root of the project, at `k8s-infra`.

## Init the hetzner context

To getting started, you must get a Token for your API as described [here](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#overview-getting-started).

Then init the hetzner context using the available `hetzner-init-context` ansible playbook.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-init-context.yml
```

This playbook has the following variables.

| Variable | Required | Prompt | Meaning |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| hetzner_context_name | x | x | context name |
| hetzner_token | x | x | The token to register with Hetzner. |

Each of the Ansible prompts can be replaced by defining it's value as an extra variable of the playbook.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-init-context.yml -e hetzner_context_name=mycontext -e hetzner_token=mytoken 
```

The context can be verified reviewing the configuration file.

```bash
$ cat  ~/.config/hcloud/cli.toml

active_context = "mycontext"

[[contexts]]
  name = "mycontext"
  token = "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
```

# The inventory

Prior to launching the creation of the VMS the Ansible inventory must be in place. For this check the documentation regarding [initializing a host](../ansible/playbook/README.md#user-guide)

> NOTE: Upon installation, Ansible will use the default SSH port to apply security scripts. One of this scripts is changing the ssh port to a non default one. 
> See the corresponding [README](../ansible/playbook/README.md).

The `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` is obtained from the `passstore` using `pass get snowdrop/hetzner/<ansible_hostname>/id_rsa | tee ~/.ssh/id_rsa_snowdrop_hetzner_<ansible_hostname>`. 
It's used so Ansible can connect to the server without requiring password.  

# The VM

## All-in-one creation

2 new playbooks have been created to aggregate the different operations executed by the different playbooks
, `hetzner-create-server-aggregate.yml` and `hetzner-delete-server-aggregate.yml`.

To create and deploy a new VM simply execute the following command on the root of the `k8s-infra` project.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-create-server-aggregate.yml -e vm_name=my_vm -e k8s_type=masters -e k8s_version=119 -e salt_text=$(gpg --gen-random --armor 1 20)  --tags create
```

| Variable | Required | Default | Prompt | Meaning |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| k8s_type | | | | Type of k8s node (masters, nodes). Will be used to set the ansible inventory groups. |
| k8s_version | | | | K8s version to be later installed. Will be used to set the ansible inventory groups. |
| salt_text | x | | | Salt and pepper. |
| vm_name | x |  | | Name of the VM to be craated. This will be both the name on Hetzner as well as on the inventory |

Removing a VM also has an aggregate playbook, requiring only the `vm_name` parameter.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-delete-server-aggregate.yml -e vm_name=my_vm
```

## Create the hetzner SSH key

Prior to creating a new VM, the SSH key generated by the Ansible Inventory must be added to the Hetzner SSH Key repository. This SSH will then be used in the server creation.

This is accomplished using the  [hetzner-create-ssh-key](ansible/hetzner-create-ssh-key.yml) playbook which will create an SSH Key with the name of the VM.

| Variable | Required | Default | Prompt | Meaning |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| vm_name | x | | x | Name of the VM to be created at hetzner. |

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-create-ssh-key.yml -e vm_name=${VM_NAME}
```


## Create the hetzner vm

The task of creating the hetzner context is also available through an Ansible playbook.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-create-server.yml
```

This will present some prompts which can be replaced by environment variables. 

| Variable | Required | Default | Prompt | Meaning |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| hetzner_context_name | x | snowdrop | | Context name for hcloud. |
| override_public_key |  | |  | Use a *local custom key* instead the default one. |
| salt_text | x | | x | Salt and pepper. |
| server_type | | cx31 |  | Server type. The list can be obtained using `hcloud server-type list`. Usually cx31 |
| vm_image | | centos-7 |  | Hetzner image to be used as source (centos-7,...) | 
| vm_name | x | | x | Name of the VM to be created at hetzner. |

Each of the Ansible prompts can be replaced by defining it's value as an extra variable of the playbook.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-create-server.yml -e vm_name=${VM_NAME} \
-e salt_text=$(head -c 500 /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 20 | head -n 1) \
-e hetzner_context_name=snowdrop
```
**REMARK**: For mac's users, please execute the following command before `export LC_ALL=C`

Once this task is finished it's mandatory to launch server securization, see the [Next steps](#next-steps) section.

## Delete a hetzner server

Delete a hetzner server vm.

| Variable | Required | Default | Prompt | Meaning |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| hetzner_context_name | x | snowdrop | | Context name for hcloud. |
| vm_name | x | | x | Name of the VM to be deleted from hetzner. |

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-delete-server.yml -e vm_name=my-name -e hetzner_context_name=snowdrop
```

After that, remove the Hetzner SSH key for the server.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook hetzner/ansible/hetzner-delete-ssh-key.yml -e vm_name=my-name
```

As well as the inventory entries for the server.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_controller_inventory_remove.yml -e vm_name=my-name -e pass_provider=hetzner
```

## Next steps

Once the server is created it must be secured before installing other software. For that check [this README file](../ansible/playbook/README.md).
