# Introduction

This document introduces some of the key concepts that you should be aware when you play with Ansible in order to configure
the environment to let Ansible to access the different machines.

When we refer to the `controller`, that means that we speak about the machine that executes the `Ansible playbooks` and `roles`
and which owns the inventory. The `hosts` are the machines where the playbooks and roles are executed against. 

The exception goes to the playbooks that are executed against `localhost`. This special host is referred to the `controller`. 

# Installation guide

In order to play with the playbooks/roles of this project, it is needed to:

* Install Ansible version 2.8 or later
  * For more installation check the [Ansible Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)
  * Ansible uses Python, so check the Ansible [Python 3 Support](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/python_3_support.html) page for more information.
* Install `passwordstore`
  * This project uses [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) to store passwords and certificates related to the project itself.
  * More information on installing pass in the Download section of the [passwordstore web page](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
* Clone the `passstore` project from GitLab.

> **NOTE**: Since passwordstore is integrated with [git](https://git-scm.com/), all changes made locally to a pass repository are automatically committed to the local git repo.
> Don't forget to `git push` and `git pull` often in order to have your local repository synchronized with other team members as well as publishing to the team your changes. 

# Introduction to Ansible Inventory

Ansible can work against multiple systems or machines in an infrastructure, called `hosts` at the same time, using a list or group of lists know as an inventory. 

Once the inventory is defined, you can select the `hosts` or `groups` where you want that Ansible runs against. The inventory is comprised of several files and scripts located under the `k8s-infra/ansible/inventory` folder.

The two most important files are: 
* `hosts.yml`: YAML file with group structure information as well as group variable assignment
* `pass_inventory.py`: Python script that dynamically builds the inventory from the `passwordstore` project. This task is done automatically when Ansible is executed. 

**Remark**: More information on the Ansible Inventory and how to build it is defined within the [Ansible User Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html).

## `hosts.yml`

This file contains static information for the inventory such as:
* Group 
* Group hierarchy
* Group variables
* Host-Group assignment - although we won't use it in this project

Here is a sample of a *hosts yaml* file designed using YAML. 

```yaml
all: # keys must be unique, i.e. only one 'hosts' per group
    hosts:
        host1:
        host2:
            host_var: value
    vars: # variables for group all (i.e. variables that will be inherited from all hosts) 
        group_all_var: value 
    children: # child groups. key order does not matter, indentation does
        other_group: # other_group is a child of the all group
            children: # group hierarchy can go on...
                group_x: 
                    hosts:
                        host5:
                group_y:
                    hosts:
                        host6:
            vars:
                g2_var2: value3
            hosts:
                host4:
                    ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
        last_group:
            hosts:
                host1:
            vars:
                group_last_var: value
```

More information on these documents are available:
* [yaml – Uses a specific YAML file as an inventory source](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/yaml_inventory.html)
* [How to build your inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

This project already includes a static inventory, at [../inventory/hosts.yml](../inventory/hosts.yml) file.

## Groups

Ansible hosts can be grouped into...well groups. This allows the execution of playbooks and the definition of variables in a common matter for different hosts.

Group definition is done inside the `ansible/inventory/hosts.yml` file using `yaml` format. In this file are the definitions of groups as well as the variable 
values assigned to each group. 

Host group assignment is made in `passstore` by managing entries in the `provider/host/groups` folder being each entry a group to which the host belongs. 

```text
├── provider
|   ├── host_1
│   │   ├── groups
│   │   │   ├── group_1
│   │   │   ├── group_2
│   │   │   ├── group_3
|   ├── host_2
│   │   ├── groups
│   │   │   ├── group_2
│   │   │   ├── group_3
```

For instance, we wanted to define the ports that a k8s master needs to open. This has been done in the `hosts.yml` file having the following variable assigned to 
the `masters` group, which is also inside a group structure so other variables are inherited. 

```
firewalld_public_ports:
  - 6443/tcp
  - 10250/tcp
  - 10255/tcp
  - 8472/udp
  - 30000-32767/tcp
```

For information regarding actually managing host-group assignment check the [`passstore_manage_host_groups` section](#passstore_manage_host_groups). 

# User Guide

Provisioning and accessing a server requires several steps, each of which will be covered in this section.

1. Manage Ansible Inventory groups [...](#group-management-in-ansible)
1. Manage Ansible Inventory host records [...](#host-management-in-ansible)
1. Create Server in Cloud Provider [...](#create-server)
1. Secure Host [...](#secure-host)
1. Install Software [...](#install-software)

## Group management in ansible

Groups are defined in the `hosts.yml` file that exists in the inventory folder [../inventory/hosts.yml](../inventory/hosts.yml). The 2 main goals of groups is to apply variable values and filter playbook execution. 

There can are different groups for the providers, ATTOW only one exists which is hetzner. The goal is one and only to fill the provider variable.

```yaml
all:
  children:
    hetzner:
      vars:
        pass_provider: hetzner
```

Another existing group is `k8s` are associated with kubernetes and assign the kubernetes version or ports to be open.

```yaml
all:
  children:
...
    k8s:
      children:
```

For instance, kubernetes group for version 1.15 defines the following variables:

```yaml
        k8s_115:
          vars:
            k8s_version: 1.15.9
            k8s_dashboard_version: v2.0.0-rc5
            coreos_flannel_sha_commit: a70459be0084506e4ec919aa1c114638878db11b
```

If it would be required to support a new kubernetes version than a new set of variables should be added to the inventory file. For instance, preparing the 
installation for version `1.17` would require adding a new group as child of the `k8s` group. It might also be required to adjust the dashboard and flannel values. 

```yaml
        k8s_117:
          vars:
            k8s_version: 1.17.4
            k8s_dashboard_version: v2.0.0-rc5
            coreos_flannel_sha_commit: a70459be0084506e4ec919aa1c114638878db11b
``` 

## Host management in Ansible

The first step is to add the host to the Ansible inventory but also to create the needed keys under the password store. This section describes how to maintain our hosts and their use.

### Updating and retrieving the inventory

As commented before, the host information (user, pwd, ssh port, ...) is obtained from the gitlab `passwordstore` team project. 

Because a host can already be defined under the store, prior to execute the playbook creating a host, check the content of the store using the following command

```bash
$ pass hetzner
hetzner
├── ...
├── host-1
│   ├── ...
├── host-2
│   ├── ...
```

According to what you will find under the `Hetzner` level, then 2 scenario will take place:

1. The host exists. Jump to the [Import a host](#Import-a-host) section;
2. The host doesn't exist. Create a new host as documented under the section [Create a host](#Create-a-host)

> NOTE: Check the [team password store documentation](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/snowdrop/passstore) if it is not yet installed on your laptop.
> 
> WARNING: Whenever a command to create host and password entries took place, then push the content using the command `pass git push` manually !!

### Import a host

If a host has already been created, it can be imported within the inventory using the command: 

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_controller_inventory.yml -e vm_name=<VM_NAME> -e pass_provider=hetzner
```
where `<VM_NAME>` corresponds to the host key created under `hetzner`

**REMARK**: It's the same playbook `passstore_controller_inventory` which is executed as the one described in the [Create a host](#Create-a-host) section but without the `create` *tag*.

### Create a host

If the host doesn't exist it must be generated and added to the Ansible inventory. 

This is done using the `passstore_controller_inventory` playbook. More information on how to use this playbook in the [`passstore_controller_inventory` section](#passstore_controller_inventory).

> NOTE: ATTOW the only supported provider is `hetzner`. 

### Remove a host 

This is done using the `passstore_controller_inventory_remove` playbook. More information on how to use this playbook in the [`passstore_controller_inventory_remove` section](#passstore_controller_inventory_remove).

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_controller_inventory_remove.yml -e vm_name=<vm_name> -e pass_provider=<provider>
```

> NOTE: ATTOW the only provider tested is `hetzner`. 

## Create Server

Once the inventory is defined the server can be provisioned, if it isn't.

There should be different playbooks for each of the providers so check the corresponding provider:

* [Hetzner](../../hetzner/README-cloud.md)

Once the server is created it must be securized. More information on the next section.

## Secure host

Host securization is of utmost importance. For this reason a specific playbook and roles have been generated to perform this task.

For the execution of the securization check the [`sec_host` playbook section](#sec_host).  

## Install software

### k8s

For information on k8s playbooks and roles check [here](../../kubernetes/README.md)

# Playbooks

List, description and usage of the implemented playbooks.

## `passstore_controller_inventory`

This playbook generates the local inventory for the host.

Variables:

| Var Name | Possible Values | Default Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vm_name | | | Name that will be assigned to  the host | 
| pass_provider | [hetzner,openstack] | hetzner | Cloud or Bare-metal provider that will host the VM |
| k8s_type | [masters,nodes] | | k8s component, see the [k8s README](../../kubernetes/README.md#ansible-inventory) |
| k8s_version | [115,116] | | k8s version to be installed, see the [k8s README](../../kubernetes/README.md#ansible-inventory) |

This playbook will create a passwordstore folder structure that will be the base for the Ansible Inventory.

An example:

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_controller_inventory.yml -e vm_name=my-host -e pass_provider=hetzner -e k8s_type=masters -e k8s_version=115 --tags create
```

This execution would generate the following `pass` structure:

```
├── hetzner
|   ├── my-host
│   │   ├── ansible_ssh_port
│   │   ├── groups
│   │   │   ├── k8s_115
│   │   │   └── masters
│   │   ├── id_rsa
│   │   ├── id_rsa.pub
│   │   ├── os_password
│   │   ├── os_user
│   │   └── ssh_port
```

...and would also create the following ssh keys:

```bash
$ ls -l ~/.ssh/
-rw-------. 1 me me  3242 jan 1 00:00 id_rsa_snowdrop_hetzner_my-host
-rw-------. 1 me me   724 jan 1 00:00 id_rsa_snowdrop_hetzner_my-host.pub
```


## `passstore_controller_inventory_remove`

This playbook will remove the records and files created by the [`passstore_controller_inventory`](#passstore_controller_inventory) playbook.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_controller_inventory_remove.yml -e vm_name=my-host -e pass_provider=hetzner
```

Variables:

| Var Name | Possible Values | Default Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vm_name | | | Name that will be assigned to  the host | 
| pass_provider | [hetzner] | hetzner | Cloud or Bare-metal provider that will host the VM |

## `sec_host`

This playbook executes several tasks regarding the security of hosts.

1. Install `firewalld` and close ports
1. Applies `sysctl` rules as described [here](https://linoxide.com/how-tos/linux-sysctl-tuning/)
    ```yaml
    # ignore ICMP packets (ping requests)
    net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1
    
    # This "sanity checking" helps against spoofing attack.
    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1
    
    # Syn Flood protection
    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
    ```
1. Sets the welcome message with proprietary information.
1. Configures `journal` so messages will persist between reboots.
1. Install `auditd`
1. Changes default ssh port 
1. Update all packages

The securization is executed using:

```bash
$  ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/sec_host.yml -e vm_name=<vm_name> -e provider=<provider>
```

Take into consideration that at the end of the securization the SSH port might be different that the default 22. This can be checked using:

```bash
$ pass show <path/to_host>/ansible_ssh_port
```

...such as...

```bash
$ pass show hetzner/my_host/ansible_ssh_port
```

Variables:

| Var Name | Possible Values | Default Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vm_name | | | Name of the host that must already exist in the Ansible inventory. | 
| provider | [hetzner] |  | Cloud or Bare-metal provider that hosts the VM |

## `passstore_manage_host_groups`

This playbook allows to easily add and remove hosts from an ansible group managed under the password store.

**WARNING**: No entries will be added or removed using this playbook within the `hosts.yaml` file !

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_manage_host_groups.yml -e operation=add -e group_name=<my_group> -e vm_name=<my_host>
```

For instance, adding a host named `n01-k115` to the `k8s_115` group would be done the following way:

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_manage_host_groups.yml -e operation=add -e group_name=k8s_115 -e vm_name=n01-k115
```

To remove the host from the group just remove the entry from the group folder as following...

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_manage_host_groups.yml -e operation=remove -e group_name=<my_group> -e vm_name=<my_host>
```

For instance, to undo the previous host operation:

```bash
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_manage_host_groups.yml -e operation=remove -e group_name=k8s_115 -e vm_name=n01-k115
```
