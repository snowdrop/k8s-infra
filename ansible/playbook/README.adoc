== Playbooks

List, description and usage of the implemented playbooks.

=== Init Controller

ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore/passstore_controller_init.yml -e pass_provider=openstack

=== `passstore_controller_inventory`

This playbook generates the local inventory for the host.

Variables:

| Var Name | Possible Values | Default Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vm_name | | | Name that will be assigned to  the host | 
| pass_provider | [hetzner,openstack] | hetzner | Cloud or Bare-metal provider that will host the VM |
| k8s_type | [masters,nodes] | | k8s component, see the [k8s README](../../kubernetes/README.md#ansible-inventory) |
| k8s_version | [119,121,123,124] | | k8s version to be installed, see the [k8s README](../../kubernetes/README.md#ansible-inventory) |

This playbook will create a passwordstore folder structure that will be the base for the Ansible Inventory.

An example:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_controller_inventory.yml -e vm_name=my-host -e pass_provider=hetzner -e k8s_type=masters -e k8s_version=115 --tags create
```

This execution would generate the following `pass` structure:

```
├── hetzner
|   ├── my-host
│   │   ├── ansible_ssh_port
│   │   ├── groups
│   │   │   ├── k8s_115
│   │   │   └── masters
│   │   ├── id_rsa
│   │   ├── id_rsa.pub
│   │   ├── os_password
│   │   ├── os_user
│   │   └── ssh_port
```

...and would also create the following ssh keys:

```bash
$ ls -l ~/.ssh/
-rw-------. 1 me me  3242 jan 1 00:00 id_rsa_snowdrop_hetzner_my-host
-rw-------. 1 me me   724 jan 1 00:00 id_rsa_snowdrop_hetzner_my-host.pub
```


=== `passstore_controller_inventory_remove`

This playbook will remove the records and files created by the [`passstore_controller_inventory`](#passstore_controller_inventory) playbook.

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_controller_inventory_remove.yml -e vm_name=my-host -e pass_provider=hetzner
```

Variables:

| Var Name | Possible Values | Default Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vm_name | | | Name that will be assigned to  the host | 
| pass_provider | [hetzner] | hetzner | Cloud or Bare-metal provider that will host the VM |

[#secure-host]
=== `sec_host`

This playbook executes several tasks regarding the security of hosts.

1. Install `firewalld` and close ports
1. Applies `sysctl` rules as described [here](https://linoxide.com/how-tos/linux-sysctl-tuning/)
    ```yaml
    # ignore ICMP packets (ping requests)
    net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1
    
    # This "sanity checking" helps against spoofing attack.
    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1
    
    # Syn Flood protection
    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
    ```
1. Sets the welcome message with proprietary information.
1. Configures `journal` so messages will persist between reboots.
1. Install `auditd`
1. Changes default ssh port 
1. Update all packages

The securization is executed using:

```bash
$  ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/sec_host.yml -e vm_name=<vm_name> -e provider=<provider>
```

Take into consideration that at the end of the securization the SSH port might be different that the default 22. This can be checked using:

```bash
$ pass show <path/to_host>/ansible_ssh_port
```

...such as...

```bash
$ pass show hetzner/my_host/ansible_ssh_port
```

Variables:

| Var Name | Possible Values | Default Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vm_name | | | Name of the host that must already exist in the Ansible inventory. | 
| provider | [hetzner] |  | Cloud or Bare-metal provider that hosts the VM |

=== `passstore_manage_host_groups`

This playbook allows to easily add and remove hosts from an ansible group managed under the password store.

**WARNING**: No entries will be added or removed using this playbook within the `hosts.yaml` file !

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_manage_host_groups.yml -e operation=add -e group_name=<my_group> -e vm_name=<my_host>
```

For instance, adding a host named `n01-k115` to the `k8s_115` group would be done the following way:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_manage_host_groups.yml -e operation=add -e group_name=k8s_115 -e vm_name=n01-k115
```

To remove the host from the group just remove the entry from the group folder as following...

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_manage_host_groups.yml -e operation=remove -e group_name=<my_group> -e vm_name=<my_host>
```

For instance, to undo the previous host operation:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/passstore_manage_host_groups.yml -e operation=remove -e group_name=k8s_115 -e vm_name=n01-k115
```
