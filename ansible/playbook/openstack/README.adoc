== Before you start

=== Choose an image

NOTE: The list of images is identified on the link:../../../openstack/README.adoc#Images[OpenStack README file].

Different OS images are available on Openstack. To select a specific image use the `openstack.vm.image` variable override.

=== Choose a flavor

NOTE: The list of flavors is identified on the link:../../../openstack/README.adoc#Flavors[OpenStack README file].

== Playbooks

=== Create a VM with Passwordstore

Create an OpenStack instance (aka a VM) using link:../../../passwordstore/README.adoc[passwordstore] as tools to manage the credentials, information.

[NOTE]
====
The playbook also uses the variables defined in the link:https://github.com/snowdrop/ansible-collection-cloud-infra/blob/main/roles/openstack_vm/defaults/main.yml[`openstack/vm role of the Snowdrop Cloud Infra Ansible Collection`] 
 that can also be overridden.

To create the RHOSP launch the `openstack_vm_create_passwordstore.yml` Ansible Playbook 
 using the following command.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/openstack/openstack_vm_create_passwordstore.yml -e '{"openstack": {"vm": {"network": "provider_net_shared","image": "Fedora-Cloud-Base-37", "flavor": "m1.medium"}}}' -e vm_name=snowdrop_sample_vm
----

[NOTE]
====
Some error messages might show on the installation process and be ignored by the installation process. Nevertheless the playbook should finish with no failed tasks.

This is a sample result of the playbook execution.

PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=68   changed=20   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=13   rescued=0    ignored=1   
vm20210221-t01             : ok=32   changed=20   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=1    rescued=0    ignored=0   
----

After creating the VM this playbook also executes the VM secure host playbook. This is an independent playbook that can be executed against any host. More information link:../README.adoc#secure-host[here].

Besides creating the VM the playbook also performs the following operations:

* Store the host SSH keys on the controller device.
* Add entries to the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file for this host.
* Add several entries to the passwordstore database in order to build the Ansible Inventory

=== Delete a VM with Passwordstore

To delete a VM, simply execute the `openstack_vm_remove_aggregate` playbook. Besides 
 removing the VM from the RHOSP it will also remove the entries from the passwordstore 
 database as well as any VM local ssh keys and entries from known hosts.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook/openstack/openstack_vm_remove_passwordstore.yml -e vm_name=snowdrop_sample_vm
----

Although some failures might occur some might be ignored which shouldn't affect thhe process. This playbook should finish with no failed tasks.
