== Introduction

[.lead]
This project details the `prerequisites` and `steps` necessary to automate the installation of a Kubernetes (aka k8s) cluster or Openshift 4 top of one of the following cloud provider:

* Red Hat https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/[OpenStack] (RHOS-PSI)
* Red Hat https://github.com/resource-hub-dev[ResourceHub] - Work in progress
* Red Hat link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform[OpenShift Container Platform] (OCP)
* IBM Cloud
* Hetzner
* Kind**

NOTE: kind is not a cloud provider but a tool able to run a k8s cluster on a container engine

== Before you start

[WARNING]
====
All the commands mentioned on this project are to be executed at the root folder of the repository, except if stated otherwise.
====

== Prerequisites

This project uses Ansible. Check the link:ansible/README.adoc[Ansible Document] for the
installation and usage instrutions.

To use the scripts, playbooks, part of this project, some prerequisites are needed. It is not mandatory to install
all of them and the following chapters will mention which ones are needed. 

* https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation[kind]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] or https://podman.io/docs/installation[podman]
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible[Ansible]. Version >= 2.14
* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python]. Version >= 3.11
* https://www.passwordstore.org/[passwordstore]
* https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli[hcloud] (optional)
* 

=== Python

Several requirements are provided as Python libraries, including Ansible, 
 and are identified on the link:requirements.txt[] file.

Using Python Virtual Environment is recomended and can be created using 
 the following command.

[source,bash]
----
python3 -m venv .snowdrop-venv
----

The python requirements can be installed by executing:

[source,bash]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

For more information check the link:ansible/README.adoc#python-venv[Python Virtual Env] section on our Ansible README. 

=== Ansible

Several Ansible Galaxy collections are used as part of this project and 
 are listed in the link:collections/requirements.yml[] file. 
 To install them execute the following command.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy install collection -r ./collections/requirements.yml --upgrade
----

== Locally

The word `locally` should be understood as the process to run on your developer laptop, the cluster, using also a CI/CD platform
such as GitHub Actions, etc.

We recommend to use 2 tools to run locally a kubernetes cluster: kind or minikube

=== Kind

_Tools: docker (or podman), kind_

To automate the installation of a k8s "kind" cluster locally like also to set up an ingress controller or a docker container registry,
use our opinionated xref:kind/README.adoc[bash scripts] :-).

You can find more information about kind tool using the official documentation - https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/

=== Minikube

_Tools: docker (or podman), minikube_

See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[official documentation] to install `minikube` on Macos, Linux or Windows

== Cloud provider

The provisioning process towards the cloud providers relies on the following assumptions:

- Password store is installed/configured and needed k/v created
- Flavor, volume, capacity (cpu/ram/volume) and OS can be mapped with the playbook of the target cloud provider
- Permissions have been set to allow to provision a VM top of the target cloud provider
- SSH key exist and has been imported (or could be created during provisioning process)

and will include the following basic steps:

- Create a VM, mount a volume and import the SSH key
- Execute a pos installation script to install some needed services
- Register the Hostnames against the domain name (using Lets'encrypt and DNS provider)
- Deploy an ocp4 cluster and configure the different ingress routes to access the console, API, registry, etc

NOTE: Optionally, we could also install different kubernetes tools if we would like to access/use the VM
(e.g. kubectl, oc, helm, k9s, konfig, ect - see tooling section).

=== Red Hat

This section details how to provision an Openshift 4 cluster using one of Red Hat environments available such as:

==== OpenStack - RHOS PSI

_Tools: password store, ansible_

The link:openstack/README.adoc[OpenStack] page explains the functionality implemented for a RHOS cloud provider.

==== https://resourcehub.redhat.com/[Resource Hub]

_Tools: password store, ansible_

Work in progress

=== IBM Cloud

_Tools: password store, ansible_

See xref:ibm-cloud/README.adoc[ibm-cloud]

=== Hetzner

==== Bare metal

_Tools: password store, ansible, hcloud_

See xref:hetzner/README.adoc[hetzner] page explaining how to create a vm.

==== Virtualized machine

_Tools: password store, ansible, hcloud_

See xref:hetzner/README-cloud.adoc[hetzner-cloud] page explaining how to create a cloud vm.

== Cluster Deployment

As the vm is now running and the docker daemon is up, you can install your `k8s` distribution using either one of the following approaches :

=== Kubernetes

You can then use the following instructions to install a Kubernetes cluster with the help of Ansible and the xref:doc/k8s.adoc[roles we created]

=== OpenShift

* Simple using the `oc` binary tool and the command https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[oc cluster up] within the vm
* More elaborated using `Ansible` tool and one of the following playbook/role:
 ** `oc cluster up` xref:doc/oc.adoc[role]
 ** `openshift-ansible` all-in-one playbook as described xref:doc/cloud.adoc[here]

== Sandbox

xref:sandbox/sandbox.adoc[Material] not actively maintained to create a VM, run on your desktop a k8s cluster or provision it with Istio, Jaeger, Fabric8 launcher, Ansible Broker catalog, etc
