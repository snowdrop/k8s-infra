= Automating the deployment of a kubernetes/ocp cluster

This project details the `prerequisites` and `steps` necessary to automate the installation of a Kubernetes (aka k8s) cluster or Openshift 4 top of one of the following cloud provider:

* Red Hat OpenStack (RHOS-PSI)
* Red Hat https://github.com/resource-hub-dev[ResourceHub] - Work in progress
* IBM Cloud
* Hetzner
* Kind**

NOTE: kind is not a cloud provider but a tool able to run a k8s cluster on a container engine

== Prerequisites

* https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation[kind]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] or https://podman.io/docs/installation[podman]
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible[Ansible]

== Locally

We recommend to use 2 tools to run locally a kubernetes cluster: kind or minikube

=== Kind

See the official documentation - https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/

To automate the installation of a k8s "kind" cluster locally like also to set up an ingress controller or a docker container registry,
use our opinionated xref:kind/README.adoc[bash scripts] we created :-).

=== Minikube

See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[official documentation] to install `minikube` on Macos, Linux or Windows

== Public Cloud provider

=== Hetzner - bare metal

* See xref:hetzner/README.adoc[hetzner] page explaining how to create a vm.

=== Hetzner Cloud - virtualized

* See xref:hetzner/README-cloud.adoc[hetzner-cloud] page explaining how to create a cloud vm.

=== IBM Cloud

* See xref:ibm-cloud/README.adoc[ibm-cloud]

=== Red Hat OpenStack - RHOS

* See xref:openstack/README.adoc[OpenStack] page explaining how to create an OpenStack cloud vm.

== Cluster Deployment

As the vm is now running and the docker daemon is up, you can install your `k8s` distribution using either one of the following approaches :

=== Kubernetes

You can then use the following instructions to install a Kubernetes cluster with the help of Ansible and the xref:doc/k8s.adoc[roles we created]

=== OpenShift

* Simple using the `oc` binary tool and the command https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[oc cluster up] within the vm
* More elaborated using `Ansible` tool and one of the following playbook/role:
 ** `oc cluster up` xref:doc/oc.adoc[role]
 ** `openshift-ansible` all-in-one playbook as described xref:doc/cloud.adoc[here]

== Sandbox

xref:sandbox/sandbox.adoc[Material] not actively maintained to create a VM, run on your desktop a k8s cluster or provision it with Istio, Jaeger, Fabric8 launcher, Ansible Broker catalog, etc
